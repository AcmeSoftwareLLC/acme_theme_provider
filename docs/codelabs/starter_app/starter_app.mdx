# Using the Acme Theme package in a new Flutter project

This codelab will help you use the Acme Theme package in the Counter App, provided by the Flutter SDK.

The MyApp class of your main.dart file will look something like this, which contains the code for the Counter app, by default.

```
void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```

Let us run the application once to see how the default starter page looks without using the themes exported from ThemeBuilder

Right away, we want to include the theme exported from ThemeBuilder, in our starter Counter app, so, let’s add that to the dependencies, under the assets as such:

```
  assets:
    - assets/example-theme.acme  
```    

Run:

```
flutter pub get 
```

from the terminal or simply follow the instructions of your IDE to get the recently added assets. 

This Codelab assumes that you have already added the acme_theme package in the pubspec.yaml of your project. If not, please go ahead and add it.

Now in your ‘main.dart’ file, let us import the Acme Theme plugin.

```

import 'package:acme_theme/acme_theme.dart';

```
