# Changing Themes

Ok, but how does this all relate to changing the theme dynamically? Let’s run the sample application first, and things will be very clear.

Secondly, navigate to the SettingsUI, by clicking on the Settings icon at the top right of the AppBar

<Image src="/assets/sample_app_settings.png" caption="Sample App Settings"/>

Here, you can see a list of themes that are selectable, go on, and select any one theme to see the dynamic changes in the themes, components and other Theme values and data.

Instantly, you can see the changes in the application. Click on ‘Done’ and navigate around the different screens to see the changes.

<Image src="/assets/sample_app_notifications_themed.png" caption="Sample App Notifications Themed"/>

<Image src="/assets/sample_app_messages_themed.png" caption="Sample App Messages Themed"/>

(The designs you see in the sample application are inspired from:

with some twists of our own. One notable change is obviously the theme and the other is the Typography used in the application.
