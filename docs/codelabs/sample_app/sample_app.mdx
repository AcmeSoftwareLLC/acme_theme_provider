# Using the Acme Theme package in the sample application

The Acme Theme package comes bundled with a sample application that can help you understand the working of the Theme Provider better. To start things off, clone the following repo:

```
https://github.com/MattHamburger/acme_theme_provider.git
```

After youâ€™ve cloned this repository, navigate to the example folder, where you will find the project files related with the sample app.

The sample app is a twitter UI clone, where you can add a tweet, change themes within the entire app and navigate between multiple screens, to see the changes in the theme.
