# Installation

In order to use the Acme Theme Provider, we need to add it to the dependencies in our pubspec.yaml file of our package.

# Depend on it

Add acme_theme to the pubspec.yaml of your project

```
dependencies:
  acme_theme: ^0.6.0
```  
  
# Install it

Run:

```
flutter pub get 
```

in your terminal, to ensure that the plugin is added or simply follow the instructions in your IDE to get the recently added plugins.

# Import it

Now in your file, you can import acme_theme as:

```
import 'package:acme_theme/acme_theme.dart';
```

Refer the docs directory and the sample project for implementation details.
